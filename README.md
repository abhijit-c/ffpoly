# ffpoly

You can find the old version of this in the _cppoldversion_ library. I scrapped
that one because I realized I was going to need arbitrary precision integers,
but there was no nice universal MIT licensed one (_shakes fist at GMP_).
Therefore I'm rewriting in python. This will take some time to rewrite.
